# sparselizard-users
Open area for user contributions. We thank you for your help.

This is the place to provide your sparselizard example code or any other contribution of interest to the community.

Examples will only be added if they have been validated numerically (visual inspection of the solution is not enough).
Please provide a description in the main.cpp of the example and as many comments as you feel is needed. Providing
details on the math is always welcome (e.g. deriving the strong form equation from a known set of equations).

No legal guarantee is provided on the examples.
